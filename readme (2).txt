CHANGELOG 09-22-2024
game is no longer case sensitive
patched VERY elusive bug where the player's active character would not change after a piece was placed until an arrow key was pressed
got rid of redundant code that would check the diagonal win conditions before it is mathematically possible to "win" diagonally
